"This paper is a major contribution of my PhD thesis. In this work, we proposed a method to classify hyperspectral images by considering both spectral and spatial information via a combined framework consisting of 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Conditional Random Field (CRF). We used multiple spectral band groups to learn deep features using CNN, and then formulate deep CRF with CNN-based unary and pairwise potential functions to effectively extract the semantic correlations between patches consisting of 3-D data cubes. Furthermore, we introduced a deep deconvolution network that improves the final classification performance. We also introduced a new data set and experimented our proposed method on it along with several widely adopted benchmark data sets to evaluate the effectiveness of our method.","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Volume: 57, Issue: 3, 1612 - 1628, September - 2018"

Classifier-Free Detection of Power Line Pylons from Point Cloud Data,"This work is a part of my PhD contributions. Considering the usefulness of Unmixing techniques, we proposed to utilize the unmixing results as an input to classifiers for better classification accuracy. We proposed a novel band group based structure preserving nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) method to estimate the individual spectral responses from different materials within different ranges of wavelengths. Then we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the unmixing results to generate powerful features and eventually classify the data."

In order to utilize both spectral and spatial information to segment remote sensing hyperspectral images, we proposed to combine the properties of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Conditional Random Field (CRF). A mean-field approximation algorithm for CRF inference is used and formulated with Gaussian pairwise potentials as Recurrent Neural Network. This combined network is then plugged into the CNN which leads to a deep network that has robust characteristics of both CNN and CRF.","IEEE, Proceedings of the IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 1-4, November - 2016"

A comparison of 3D shape retrieval methods based on a large-scale benchmark supporting multimodal queries,"This paper features the major contributions of my Masters thesis. The main contribution of this paper is the inclusion of spatial relationships among the Object of Interest (OOI) fragments into the model in order to narrow this gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics. For this purpose, we employ Bayesian networks as a probabilistic approach for learning the spatial relationships which, in turn, becomes evidence that is used for the process of segmenting future instances of the OOI. The algorithm presented in this paper also uses multiple instance learning to obtain prototypical descriptions of each fragment of the OOI based on low-level visual features. The experimental results on both artificial and real image datasets indicate that the addition of spatial relationships improves segmentation performance."

"This article was awarded as the best paper in the said conference. The different looking fragments of the same object impose the main challenge of producing a good segmentation. This leads to consider the high-level semantics of an image as well as the low-level visual features which require computationally intensive operations. This demands to optimize the computations as much as possible in order to reduce both computational and communication complexity. This paper proposes a framework which can be used to perform segmentation for a particular object by incorporating optimization in subsequent steps. The algorithm proposes an optimized K-means algorithm for image segmentation followed by balance calculations in multiple instance learning and topological relations with relative positions to identify OOI regions. Finally, a bayesian network is incorporated to contain the learned information about the model of the OOI. The preliminary experimental results suggest a significant drop in the complexity.","IEEE, Proceedings of the International Conference on Informatics, Electronics and Vision (ICIEV), 1-8, August - 2013"

Because data mining is an important step in knowledge discovery, we can extract hidden and non-trivial information from raw data and predict a pattern that adds additional intelligence in our framework to make it more transparent and free of corruption. In this paper, we have utilized the significant functionalities of decision-tree classifiers in order to predict a transaction pattern for every concerned entity followed by handling all kinds of transactions by electronic means, and continuously monitoring them over the entire network.","The Smart Computing Review, Volume 3, Issue 4, 246-260, 2013"

Incorporating shape into spatially-aware adaptive object segmentation algorithm,"This is the last contributory work from my Masters thesis. In this work, we revised the concept of directional spatial templates and introduce regional directional spatial templates as a means of including spatial relationships among Object of Interest (OOI) regions into the model. We presented an object segmentation algorithm that learns a model which includes both visual and spatial information. Given a training set of images containing the OOI, each image is oversegmented into visually homogeneous regions. Next, Multiple Instance Learning identifies regions that are likely to be part of the OOI. For each pair of such regions and for each relationship, a regional template is formed. The computational cost of template generation is reduced by sampling the reference region with a pixel set that is descriptive of its shape. Experiments indicate that regional templates are an effective way of including spatial information into the model which in turn results in a very significant improvement in segmentation performance."

Continuous functioning of soft system bus based centralized persistent computing system,"This is the second contribution of my Masters thesis. Our proposed object-specific segmentation algorithm (the first contribution of my Masters) learns a model of the objects which includes information on both the visual appearance of and the spatial relationships among the objects components. However, its performance heavily depends on the assumption that the visual appearance variability among object instances is low. We present an extension to our algorithm that relaxes this assumption by incorporating shape information into the object model."

Real-time Waste Paper Grading Using CBR Approach,"This is the first contributory work from my Masters thesis. During the initial phases of my research, I noticed that due to the objects consisting of different-looking fragments, traditional image segmentation algorithms that are based on the identification of homogeneous regions tend to oversegment. In this work, we used Multiple Instance Learning to learn prototypical representations of each fragment of the OOI and a Bayesian network to learn the spatial relationships that exist among those fragments. The Bayesian network, as a probabilistic graphical model, in turn becomes evidence that is used for the process of semantically accurate segmentation of future instances of the objects. The key contribution of this paper is the inclusion of domain-specific information in terms of spatial relationships as an input to a conventional Bayesian network structure learning algorithm."
